	Alright go figure that when i try put effort into something and even help people out as i get screwed over constantly the little i got going for me goes wrong.

	From people spreading lies ranging from "you sold public mirror" and "you promote pU, totally a mirror paste" levels of pathetic to outright bullshit like
	"you're faking dumping clips and damaging my income by leaking cfgs (from people who make 2k+ a month just from YT)", i'm starting to wonder if  i'm just crazy for thinking
	that talking and discussing shit over ruining the one hobby and source of income i (and others) had and enjoyed is supposed to be common sense.

	i mean seriously, you have brainlets who justify doxxing (which isn't a new thing in my case), spamming my email, ruining a decent src of income with "well mirror has some pasted
	code and freak takes hormones therefore ddosing everyone who lives in that same house who need it for online uni is justified". Don't believe me? Have a look at some forums and even 
	r/csgohacks. Am i crazy for thinking this is retarded? I mean, this comes from the same people who compare a free cheat to a cheat by people who ban faster than their 20€
	cheat shoots fakes, defending it in the meantime, so maybe i ain't? But i don't even know. We are in the scene of people make one lose income and then are surprised i can't pay them
	to remove strikes.

	Speaking of which, the fuck have i done wrong? Is me being transgender just unforgiveable? Is making a couple jokes at a cheat that you're expected to pay for unthinkable thus needing
	to be silenced? I'm being serious, what sort of person claims i'm irrelevant whilst literally somehow finding my god damn university ID and religously commenting excuses on all my videos
	and even disliking the video in the time it takes to press "Public" and add tags + keywords to a video? How does even one do that? +/-5 out of my last 10 videos prior to me making them 
	private had this. I'd click publish, upload the thumbnail, add a game title, tweak the tags, load up the video (in total about 10 seconds) just to see if it's up right and 
	if the thumbnail is working (yt has a bug relating to that), and there would be 1-2 dislikes. 

	So yeah, irl, shit just sucks and i can't have one thing go right for me, i would go into it, but the guy who's looked at my roof through google maps can probably figure it out him(it)-self
	and in this absolute shit show of a scene filled with wannabe celebreties who think being recognized by 4 people in a server = being famous and people who do this. I never scammed,
	i never lied, when i was wrong i corrected myself (afaik) and i didn't shit talk anyone to a serious extent (unless you think of signal and his yes-men stooges who i could write
	a fucking essay on), but i guess i'm just deserving of all this and i don't know why.

	Do with this source as you please, and if you're gonna jack off to how superior you are, do it in a hvh server where everyone totally cares. 
	Fuck all this, seriously.
